![takahē](static/img/logo-128.png)

An *experimental* Fediverse server for microblogging/"toots". Not fully functional yet -
we're still working towards a 1.0!

**Current version: [0.5.0](https://docs.jointakahe.org/en/latest/releases/0.5/)**

Key features:

- Multiple domain support
- Multiple identities per user (and can be shared between users)
- Desktop, mobile and PWA-compatible web UI (with minimal JavaScript)
- Easy deployment (web worker, background worker, and one database)
