Takahē
======


Welcome to the Takahē documentation! Takahē is an ActivityPub server, designed
for small- to medium-size installations, and with the ability to serve multiple
domains at once.

This documentation is still in development, and will be patchy while Takahē is
in alpha. For more information about Takahē, see
`the official site at jointakahe.org <https://jointakahe.org>`_.
