Features
========

TakahÄ“ is currently in development, so it does not yet have all the features
of a full ActivityPub server.

Currently, it supports:

* Web UI only (but can be installed as a PWA)
* Creating, editing and deleting posts, with CWs/summaries and visibility
* Adding and showing images on posts (with image descriptions)
* Handling replies and reply threading
* Creating and receiving boosts and likes
* Delivering mentions, and notifications for incoming mentions
* Following and unfollowing, and you-were-followed notifications
* Post visibilities, including a local-only option
* A home timeline, a local timeline, and a federated timeline
* Profile pages with bios, icons, and header images
* RSS feeds for users' public posts
* Hashtag linking and searching
* Emoji fetching and display, and limited admin creation
* Searching for users by exact handle
* Multiple domain support
* Multiple identity (per user account support)
* Moderation flagging system and queue
* Server defederation (blocking)
* Signup flow
* Password reset flow
* Hashtag trending system with moderation
* Mastodon-compatible client API for use with apps (alpha stage)

Features planned for releases up to 1.0:

* Handling received polls and voting on them
* Manual approval of followers
* Emoji admin page
* Server announcements system
* IP and email domain banning

Features that may make it into 1.0, or might be further out:

* Creating polls on posts
* Filters
* Bookmarks
* Lists
* Scheduling posts
* Mastodon-compatible account migration target/source
* Relay support

Features on the long-term roadmap:
