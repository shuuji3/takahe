    <form action="." method="POST">
        <h1>Add A Domain</h1>
        <p>
            Use this form to add a domain that your users can create identities
            on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Takahē supports multiple domains per server, but note that when
            identities are created they are <b>fixed to their chosen domain</b>,
            and you will <b>not be able to delete a domain with identities on it</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you will be serving Takahē on the domain you choose, you can leave
            the "service domain" field blank. If you would like to let users create
            accounts on a domain serving something else, you must pick a unique
            "service domain" that pairs up to your chosen domain name, make sure
            Takahē is served on that, and add redirects
            for <tt>/.well-known/webfinger</tt>, <tt>/.well-known/host-meta</tt>
            and <tt>/.well-known/nodeinfo</tt> from the main domain to the
            service domain.
